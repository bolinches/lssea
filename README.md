# lssea
Display Shared Ethernet Adapter (SEA) status

Most of the work was initiated and done by Mathias Kabiersch. I got his script on 2012 and been using heavily since then. Unfortunately Mathias passed away. Some modifications to his original code had been done to manage active active SEA and some other clean up. I just thought this script is too useful and good to fade away with Mathias.

In respectful memory of Mathias. Thanks, sir.
